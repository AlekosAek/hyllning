      <p>Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison.
        Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk
        released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the
        1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad
        coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the
        country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights
        abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist
        beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services.
        Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as
        secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was
        succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and
        HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.</p>

          Nelson Mandela was the president of South Africa
          from 1994-1999. He was the first black president of
          South Africa, and the first president to be elected in a
          fully representative election.

          Nelson Mandela's government focused on destroying the Apartheid government in the country,
          which had focused on racial segregation enforced by the law.

        <li>
          Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for peacefully destroying the Apartheid regime and laying the
          foundation for democracy. In addition to
          the Nobel Piece Prize, he won over 250 other awards.
